## Assessment of First 50 Days

The factory started Day 0 with 3 stuffers, 2 testers, 1 tuner, 9,600 kits, and $0 cash. After 50 days of operation under Contract 1 ($750/7-day lead time), we observe:

- **Demand**: Approximately [X] orders/day ([X x 60] kits/day), consistent with a stable arrival pattern
- **Bottleneck**: Station 2 (Testing) shows the highest utilization at approximately [X]%, driven by double-pass processing (Steps 2 and 4). Stations 1 and 3 show lower utilization at ~[X]% and ~[X]%, respectively
- **Lead times**: Currently averaging [X] days, [above/below] the 7-day Contract 1 threshold
- **Inventory**: Current stock is approximately [X] kits with reorder point at [X] and order quantity at [X]
- **Cash**: Approximately $[X] on hand

## Operational Plan (Days 50-385)

### Phase 1: Capacity Relief (Days 50-70)
**Immediate**: Purchase 1 additional tester ($80K) to alleviate the Station 2 bottleneck. If Station 3 utilization is also high, purchase 1 additional tuner ($100K). Adjust the reorder point to ~3,600 kits and order quantity to ~5,400 kits to balance cash preservation with stockout prevention.

### Phase 2: Contract Upgrade (Days 70-120)
Once additional capacity brings average lead times consistently below 1 day, switch from Contract 1 ($750) to Contract 2 ($1,000). This 33% revenue increase is the primary profit driver. If needed, use the line of credit (available Day 100) to fund additional capacity investments -- an $80K tester generating ~$3,000/day additional revenue from the contract upgrade pays for itself within a month.

### Phase 3: Fine-Tuning (Days 120-300)
Monitor utilization and lead times daily. Consider: (a) splitting lots to 2x30 to reduce flow time if capacity margins are comfortable; (b) adjusting Station 2 scheduling to "Priority to Step 4" to expedite near-complete orders; (c) upgrading to Contract 3 ($1,250) if lead times reliably stay below 0.5 days. Repay any outstanding loans as quickly as possible to minimize interest expense.

### Phase 4: End-Game Preparation (Days 300-385)
Calculate exact inventory needs for Days 385-485 (~100 days of demand). Gradually reduce reorder quantities, eventually setting order quantity to 0 when sufficient stock is on hand. Ensure all debt is repaid. Leave factory settings optimized for the 100-day unmanaged period: appropriate contract for current capacity, stable inventory policy, and enough machines to maintain low lead times.

## Team Coordination
[Team member 1] monitors capacity/lead times and makes machine purchases. [Team member 2] manages inventory policy and contract switching. Both check the dashboard 3-4x daily during the 5-day simulation window, with scheduled check-ins every [12 hours] to coordinate decisions.
